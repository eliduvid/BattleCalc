# BattleCalc
Interpreter for simplified assembly-like language. Originally was hosted on gitlab and intended as a learning tool, but ended up never used like one. Working version available at https://battle-calc.neocities.org/

[I tried to host it on github pages, but require.js model I used then for some reason is not compatible with it ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è]

Yeah, and historic origins of the name are complicated and not so interesting.
